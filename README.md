# tutorial

Exploration of how to use some aspects of the overtone library in Clojure.

## Usage

This file is intended to be worked through in a "literate programming"
manner, evaluating one expression at a time.

## Purpose

The ultimate goal is to convert some of the basic utilities here to
work as a generative composition program, along the lines of [an earlier project of mine in Pure Data](https://github.com/cicerojones/ICMC-generative-music)
