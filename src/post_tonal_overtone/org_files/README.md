# How to Use Org Mode files to learn Clojure and Overtone
## Description
The idea here seems to be that moving through one file after another,
and evaluating code while reading through the descriptions is a good
way to get started playing.

What will inevitably happen is that you will be prompted by something
to test out an idea. Which you can then document within the scope of
the file or a new file, as you see fit.

But it will help to have a series of graded files to work through, as
a kind of etude book.

## Gradus ad Parnassum

Right now, since this is a work in process, it would appear that from
time of last usage, this is reverse order in which I use these files. 

 modeling-musical-time

- getting-started

- build-voice-leading-engine

- post-tonal-lib-overview

- using-post-tonal-harmonies


Which means that there should be a simple first document, which
`using-post-tonal-harmonies` is most certainly not.

### Steps
One way to figure out the best technique for developing skills in this
ecosystem is to close up emacs and start from scratch (perhaps more
often than you would like!).

Starting from scratch has its drawbacks (you don't want to have to
reinvent the wheel *every* day, but it doesn't hurt to see what you
really remember to have to go through a series of steps repeatedly.
Almost an exact description of playing scales!
