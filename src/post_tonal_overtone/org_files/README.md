# How to Use Org Mode files to learn Clojure and Overtone

The idea here seems to be that moving through one file after another,
and evaluating code while reading through the descriptions is a good
way to get started playing.

What will inevitably happen is that you will be prompted by something
to test out an idea. Which you can then document within the scope of
the file or a new file, as you see fit.

But it will help to have a series of graded files to work through, as
a kind of etude book.
