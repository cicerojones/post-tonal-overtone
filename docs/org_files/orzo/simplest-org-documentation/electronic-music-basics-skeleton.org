* electronic music essential concepts and techniques
** explanation and rationale
Because all these music making environments use a similar set of
concepts but translate them into different language or different
techniques of combination, it would make sense to develop a basic
high-level understanding of what the essentials are to a quick recipe
for making something sonically interesting using any particular
language or environment.

The peculiarities of Pd vs. Supercollider vs. Overtone are partially
ones of language and partly ones of implementation of the same set of
basic concepts. 

Let's imagine a set of the basic concepts and see how they would work
with that set of three named above.
** some basic concepts
*** synthesis--wave types
*** filtering
*** envelopes
*** timing and delays
*** wave modulation
